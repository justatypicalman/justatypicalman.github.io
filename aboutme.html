            <h1>Hello, I am Eric T. Dango, currently 18 years old. 
              I was born on December 16, 2002 and I live in the Philippines. My mother's name is 
              Victoria and my father's name is Higinio, my Mom took 
              care of me since ever since I was a child as my Father 
              went abroad working as HVAC Technician and I was 
              fortunate enough to pursue my dream, they did not 
              control me on what I am going to be and what course 
              I should take. I discovered when I was grade 8 that 
              coding is my passion, and when I am Grade 10, 
              I realized that I should do whatever it takes to be 
              a Full-Stacked Web Developer and now I am close to 
              achieving it. But not all the times I am coding, 
              I sometimes play Mobile Legends or Valorant whenever 
              I am going through tough times and also if I have 
              free time. One of my skills or talents is I can pick up 
              any field fast but will never be good at it so I am 
              going to upgrade my coding skill from being okay to 
              perfect, I also play guitar or ukulele and sometimes 
              I am helping my neighbors or friends to install an 
              Operating System on their PC or help them trobleshoot 
              their PC. My Strengths and Weaknesses is I am Workaholic 
              when it comes to programming or coding, to the point that 
              I sometimes do not care about my health and ignore all 
              sickness when I am determined to my activities, I considered 
              it as my strength and also my weakness. With all that said, 
              my career after graduating is going to be a Back-End Web 
              Developer or a Full-Stacked Web Developer and I am going 
              to get this job no matter what hurdles may come.</h1>
